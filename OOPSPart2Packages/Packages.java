public class Packages {

//    Packages are container for classes or boxes for classes.
//    This is used to keep class name in compartments.
//    If we need 2 classes with same name , we use packages.
//    Packages are used to create folder inside folders[Stored in hierachial manner].

//    Packages are container for classes. They are used to keep the class name space compartmentalized.
//    Packages are stored in hierarchial manner and are explicitly imported into new class definition.
//    A package is both a naming and visibility control mechanism.
//    Java uses file system directories to store a package.
//    The directory name must match the package name exactly.
//    A package hierachy must be reflected int the file system of your java development system.

//    By default , the java runtime system uses the current working directory ,as its starting point.Thus , if your package is in subdirectory of the current directory , it will be found.
//    You can specify a directory path or paths by sending the classPath enviorment variable.

//    When a package is imported , only those items within the package declared as public will be available to non subclass in the importing code.
